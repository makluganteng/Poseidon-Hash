# Poseidon-Hash
Poseidon Hash implementation using Rust.

## Why Re-build this ? 
After watching a video on YT and also auditing Poseidon hash now i feel like trying to implement it on my own from what i understand just to understand how poseidon hash actually work and why its able to reduce the constraint than a normal hashing.
